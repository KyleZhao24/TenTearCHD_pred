##The primary objective of this exploratory data analysis (EDA) is to lay a strong
analytical foundation for the development of a predictive model aimed at identifying individuals at high risk of developing coronary heart disease (CHD) within the next 10 years. This predictive endeavor is crucial for early intervention strategies and enhancing patient outcomes by targeting preventive measures to those most at risk.
